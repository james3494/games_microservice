# Takeout microservice
A microservice for the gameplay for the takeOut app. 

## To do

- move validation out to seperate module

- nail down who can access things ,and whether the returned object changes depending on who accessed it

- More tests could be created for error catching. 

- create endpoints like /game/:_id/takeouts to get takeouts? Similarly /user/:_id/games ? 

- method for checking whether a player is part of a game from the controller
