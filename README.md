# Takeout microservice
A microservice for the gameplay for the takeOut app. 

## To do

- make location a genuine location rather than a string

- write some tests to check access

- do anything about maxduration? auto complete?

- auto finish games that have not started 4 hours after their expectedStartTime

- which packs can be chosen for a game? can each admin choose their own purchased pack? Only the owners packs? (I think the first at the monent). In which case, how do we verify in initiateGame whether the pack is legit?
