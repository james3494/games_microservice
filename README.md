# Takeout microservice
A microservice for the gameplay for the takeOut app. 

## To do

- make location a genuine location rather than a string

- write some tests to check access

- do anything about maxduration? auto complete?

- auto finish games that have not started 4 hours after their expectedStartTime

- tests for editing games.

- should only be able to disable takeout methods and create them. NO EDITING. THat could cause problems

- add reviewing to takeoutMethods

- add takeoutMethod packs
