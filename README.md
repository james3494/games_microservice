- write some tests to check access

- do anything about maxduration? auto complete?

- auto finish games that have not started 4 hours after their expectedStartTime

- check it is the chaser creating a rating for a takeout method

- method for getting number of times a pack / takeoutMethod has been played and including it in the get endpoint

- verify when editing packs. E.g has it been played? Has it been downloaded? etc. Certain things won't be able to change after this has happened.
