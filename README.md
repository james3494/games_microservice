# Takeout microservice
A microservice for the gameplay for the takeOut app. 

## To do

- make location a genuine location rather than a string

- write some tests to check access

- do anything about maxduration? auto complete?

- auto finish games that have not started 4 hours after their expectedStartTime

- add reviewing to takeoutMethods

- add takeoutMethod packs

- split takeout methods into a seperate microservice?

- make only possible to delete an awaiting game

- check always at least one admin - cannot leave a game if you are the only admin
