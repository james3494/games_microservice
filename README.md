# Takeout microservice
A microservice for the gameplay for the takeOut app. 

## To do

- make location a genuine location rather than a string

- write some tests to check access

- create endpoints like /game/:_id/takeouts to get takeouts? Similarly /user/:_id/games ? 

- make takeout include the takeoutMethod text then make takeout methods only accessible by admins?
