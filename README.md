# Takeout microservice
A microservice for the gameplay for the takeOut app. 

## To do

- make location a genuine location rather than a string

- write some tests to check access

- do anything about maxduration? auto complete?

- auto finish games that have not started 4 hours after their expectedStartTime

- verify when editing packs. E.g has it been played? Has it been downloaded? etc. Certain things won't be able to change after this has happened.

- make rating and pack / packPurchase tests
