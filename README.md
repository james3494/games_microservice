# Takeout microservice
A microservice for the gameplay for the takeOut app. 

## To do

- move validation out to seperate module

- create controllers for all of the required routes. 

- nail down who can access things ,and whether the returned object changes depending on who accessed it

- create a delete game endpoint, ehich also removes associated takeouts.
- these are both dangerous but would be useful for testing. Maybe should only be exosed for testing?
