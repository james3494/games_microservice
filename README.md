# Takeout microservice
A microservice for the gameplay for the takeOut app. 

## To do

- move validation out to seperate module

- create controllers for all of the required routes. 

- nail down who can access things ,and whether the returned object changes depending on who accessed it

- implement more tests to check error catching. 

- spin up a new database and delete it for testing. Testing script which asks about errors and what to test etc.

- create endpoints like /game/:_id/takeouts to get takeouts? Similarly /user/:_id/games ?
